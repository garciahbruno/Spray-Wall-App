🧗 SprayWallBuilder

SprayWallBuilder is a SwiftUI app that lets climbers turn any spray wall into a fully interactive training tool. Whether you're training alone or logging sessions with friends, this app lets you upload a wall image, tap to place holds, and create custom routes with color-coded sequences — all from your iPhone.
🔍 Features

    📸 Custom Wall Upload: Import a photo of your spray wall and instantly make it interactive

    🎯 Tap-to-Add Holds: Just tap to add holds, choose color and size, and place them anywhere on the wall

    🧩 Route Builder: Create named routes, assign hold sequences, and save them for later

    💾 Local Storage: All walls and routes are stored locally using Swift's native persistence tools

    🗑️ Edit & Delete Routes: Swipe to delete, edit routes, and update holds on the fly

    📱 Clean SwiftUI Interface: Designed with simplicity and usability in mind for real climbers

🤸‍♂️ Why I Built This

As a climber, I wanted a simple tool to visualize and train on spray walls without needing expensive or restrictive systems. SprayWallBuilder was my solution — a lightweight app that gives climbers full control over their training setup.
